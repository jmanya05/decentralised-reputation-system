# decentralised-reputation-system

This is a decentralised reputation system that uses the novel credential system named Coconut which can be reviewed here https://github.com/asonnino/coconut.

Firstly, the client receives a credential from 5 authorities that are not related to the merchant. Then, the client buys an item from the merchant and the latter gives the client the article along with a signature and the receipt of the purchase.

Then, the client uses his or her credential, the signature and the receipt to rate an item if he liked it or not.
